SleepsimR-data is an R library that contains scripts used to generate simulation scenarios and to preprocess the simulation results. This library contains all raw data, summary statistics, simulation scenarios and simulation results obtained in the course of the study.

This program was created as part of my Master's thesis. For more information, read the full documentation at: https://github.com/JasperHG90/sleepsimR-documentation
